Description: Provides tools for setting up in-memory OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) 
    databases with synthetic data for testing, development, and demonstration purposes. 
    Supports multiple approaches including Eunomia datasets from the OHDSI community 
    and custom synthetic data generation. The package facilitates rapid prototyping 
    and testing of OMOP CDM applications without requiring access to real healthcare data.
